<h1>Introduction of Elephant </h1>
<p> ElephaNT IS Bigest animal of the worlds. <b>There are two species of elephants remaining in the world</b> â€“ <br/>the African and the Asian. They range in color from light to dark gray, with the most distinct features being their huge ears and tusks. These tusks though have resulted in the deaths of thousands of elephants though. These formidable appendages are made from ivory. Even though it is now illegal to trade or sell ivory in many countries, it continues to be profitable on the black market and has resulted in the violent murder of thousands of these wonderful animals.

Elephants are some of <i>the largest creatures in the world</i>.</p> They are also known
 to be extremely intelligent. The saying that someone has the memory of an elephant means
 that they can remember just about anything and should be taken as a compliment. For the most 
 part these are gentle animals but they <br/>will attack if they feel themselves or their offspring are in danger.
